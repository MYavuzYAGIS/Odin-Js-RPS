The main objective of the assignment was very straightforward : creating the game.
Although I could have done it by taking user inputs through `alert` and bulding the game that way, I wanted to take my time and dedicate a webpage for it.

This enabled the game to have a good UI, and enabled me to learn much much things than what I could have learned If I had opted with the alert option, and also practiced some Sass on the way, double win :).

On the making process, I practiced many of the `DOM` manipulation methods, gained many side benefits otherwise I could not have. 
As an immdediate outcome, I feel much more flexible and comfortable with JS and DOM elements. How to manipulate them, how `not` to manipulate them, and what is the best of the alternatives to implement.

This was worth of 2 full tutorials. 

## Take it from me : `Practice is the best tutorial!`
